# hello-world
Ummmm

Hello there! I'm still trying to figure out exactly what GitHub is. It seems like it's useful, so I figured it was about time to see what the fuss is all about. I'm still fairly new to programming, so hopefully this will help me improve. I have a cool idea for a project that I'll try to work on this summer, so (fingers-crossed), I'll upload the finished product here when I'm done.
